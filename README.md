# Perfusion_Chip
Perfusion chamber for direct ink writing

The lid currently fits a standard microscope slide (cut to 25 mm long using a glass scorer) sealed with Sylgard 184. 
Likewise, the gasket to seal the base and the lid is made by filling the mould with Sylgard 184 and can easily be extracted by running a scalpel along the outer edge. 
The gasket is then inserted into the notch on the top of the base. 
Finally, the base is glued to either a microscope slide or a 5 mm diameter circular cover slip using Sylgard 184. 
You’ll want to insert a 22/23 Gauge metal dispense tip to act as a mould for when you insert polypropylene dispense tips for catheterisation. 
The whole thing is held together by M3 hex nuts hammered into the base and M3x5 mm socket caps through the top.
 
The design for the base has some things that I’m not keen on. Things don’t currently work reliably enough for me stick my name on it too proudly, but everything “sort of” works.
 
The chip itself is based on the (somewhat more mature) chip designed by Jordan Miller’s group:

Thomas Molley has designed something slightly more appropriate for direct printing, but maybe not so great in other ways:
